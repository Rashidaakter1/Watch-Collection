How React Works?
React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) for user interfaces.React does not read the changes of state one after the other if there are multiple state changes.but it makes a virtual dom .Then it compares the virtual dom and actual dom and if there react finds any changes,it swiftly changes the actual dom.


What are the differences between props and state ?
1.Props are used to pass data from one component to another but State are used to pass data within component.
2.Props is Immutable but State is Mutable.
3.Props are read-only but States are not Read-only

#How React Works?
#React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) for user interfaces.React does not read the changes of state one after the other if there are multiple state changes.but it makes a virtual dom .Then it compares the virtual dom and actual dom and if there react finds any changes,it swiftly changes the actual dom.
